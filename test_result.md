## Backend API Tests

### All Endpoints Tested Successfully ‚úÖ

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Health check - returns Sakha message |
| `/api/words` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Returns 100 random Sakha words |
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | ‚úÖ PASS | User registration with JSON payload |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | ‚úÖ PASS | Login with form-data, returns JWT token |
| `/api/users/me` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Protected endpoint, requires Bearer token |
| `/api/results` | POST | ‚úÖ PASS | Save test results, updates user profile |
| `/api/results/user/{username}` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Retrieve user's test history |
| `/api/profile/{username}` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Get user profile with statistics |
| `/api/leaderboard/wpm` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | WPM leaderboard |
| `/api/leaderboard/accuracy` | GET | ‚úÖ PASS | Accuracy leaderboard |

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ Authentication System
- Registration works with JSON payload
- Login correctly uses form-data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
- JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- Protected endpoints correctly require Bearer token authentication

#### ‚úÖ Data Persistence & Consistency
- Test results are saved correctly to database
- User profiles are automatically updated after saving results:
  - `total_tests` incremented
  - `best_wpm` and `best_accuracy` updated when improved
  - Experience points calculated and level updated
- Data consistency verified between results and profile endpoints

#### ‚úÖ Words System
- Returns exactly 100 words as requested
- Words are in Sakha language (e.g., '–ø–∞–º—è—Ç—å', '—Å–∏—Ä', '–º–∏—Ä', '–∞“ï—ã—Å', '—É—á—ë–±–∞')
- Random selection working properly

#### ‚úÖ Leaderboards
- Both WPM and accuracy leaderboards functional
- Properly populated with user data after test completion
- Correct sorting (descending order for best scores)

### Test Data Used
- **Username:** testuser
- **Password:** test1234
- **Test Result:** WPM: 65.5, Accuracy: 93.5%, Duration: 30s

### Database Verification
- SQLite database properly initialized
- All tables created and functional
- Foreign key relationships working
- Data persistence confirmed across server restarts

## Overall Assessment

**Status: üéâ ALL TESTS PASSED**

The Sakhatype backend API is fully functional with all 10 specified endpoints working correctly. The system demonstrates:

1. **Robust Authentication:** Secure JWT-based auth with proper form-data login
2. **Data Integrity:** Consistent data storage and retrieval across all endpoints  
3. **Performance:** Fast response times for all API calls
4. **Localization:** Proper Sakha language support in words database
5. **Statistics Tracking:** Accurate user progress and leaderboard functionality

No critical issues found. The backend is ready for production use.
